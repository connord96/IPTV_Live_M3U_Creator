# IPTV_Live_M3U_Creator
Automated class that trawls through IPTVCat for active streams and produces an M3u.

Instructions:
1) Download and install the repository - Update the location of the data file, chrome driver and download locations etc.
3) Add the channels you want to search for into the 'channels.xlsx' excel file.
4) Simply run the test class and allow a few minutes for it to generate the m3u list (The more channels, the longer it'll take). 20 channels = 3 mins (You do the Math....)
