# IPTV_Live_M3U_Creator
Automated class that trawls through IPTVCat for active streams and produces an M3u.

Instructions:
1) Download and install the repository.
2) Add the channels you want to search for into the 'channels.xlsx' excel file.
3) Simply run the test class and allow a few minutes for it to generate the m3u list (The more channels, the longer it'll take). 20 channels = 3 mins (You do the Math....)
